-Create 2 pages, a Home page and a Shopping page (use router to switch pages)
-navbar on both pages to go back and forth between pages
-create a cart which stores items to purchase, make it an array/object that gets updated when something is added or removed
-number of cart items and cart price value should update whenver changed (state)
-maybe write tests with react testing library
